# Bazaar-Buddies

## Description
We are mimicking the famous site from the early 2000s, Craigslist. For this project, the team is using MERN to format, create and structure the whole application from scratch. The focus of this team is to demonstrate each member's ability and technical skills in creating a diverse and interactive application.


On this website, the user can search and post any products listed on the site. To search for an item,  the user can use the "search" bar on top of the page or the sidebar to find a specific item within a category. To post on the site, the user can click on "post" to be taken to the posting page and follow the prompt to post any item.
